FastIoT is a framework for rapid development of IIoT-Systems using Python as main programming language.
It helps to set up a micro-service architecture and create services. The development has been started as basis for
various research projects at Fraunhofer IVV, Dresden, Germany.

To get started quickly it is equipped with a powerful command line interface (CLI): `fiot`.
This helps setting up a new project, create new services and run tests.
It also supports creating cross-architecture Docker-containers and deployment configurations with docker-compose files
and Ansible playbooks to bring the software to the systems they belong. Run `fiot --help` for a full list of features.

As for now the overall framework has only been used and tested on Linux systems.
