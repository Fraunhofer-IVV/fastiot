Quick start

*This should help getting started quickly. A more detailed description can be found in the tutorials.*

It is always recommended to use a separate virtual environment for each project, so letâ€™s create one:
:command:`python3 -m venv venv` and use it: :command:`source venv/bin/activate`

Afterwards you can install FastIoT: :command:`python3 -m pip install fastiot`

To setup a new project with the name ``my_first_project`` you can now run:
:command:`fiot create new-project my_first_project`.

Within this repository you can find some sample services to use as template.
Or you can simply ask the CLI to create a new services: :command:`fiot create new-service my_first_service`.
You should now find a service stub in your project to be extended with your application logic.
The service will be added to the deployment "full" automatically.

You can now also create deployment configurations (e.g. a :file:`docker-compose.yaml`) using :command:`fiot config` and
build containers for your project using :command:`fiot build`.

As the service has been added to a deployment automatically you now start the service (with broker) with the command
:command:`fiot start full`. You should see the log messages from sending and receiving data. To cancel just press
:kbd:`Ctrl` + :kbd:`C`.

For a more comprehensive list of features, a guide to the project structure please refer to the complete documentation.

To run services locally, in your IDE or within a container please refer to the tutorials section in this documentation.
