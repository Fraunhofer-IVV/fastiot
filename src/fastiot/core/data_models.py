    This is basically a Pydantic model with the additional handling of subjects. So any Pydantic model should work here,

    The subject is constructed from the model name, e.g. if your data model is called ``MySpecialModel`` a subject
    ``v1.my_special_subject`` will be created. If you want to have more control over the subject name you may overwrite
    the method :meth:`fastiot.core.data_models.FastIoTData.get_subject` in your data model or create a new model based
    on Pydanticâ€™s :class:`pydantic.BaseModel`. See :ref:`publish-subscribe` for more details about publish and
